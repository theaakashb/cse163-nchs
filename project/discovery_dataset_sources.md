The best approach is to start with a problem that interests you, and then look for data. However, if you are creative and critical, you can go the other way around: start with the data and then identify areas of research.    

There are MANY sources of data and you can seek out anything and everything you can get your hands on. Google will be your friend for finding a dataset.Here are some sources for you to explore:
