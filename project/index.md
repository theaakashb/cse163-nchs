# Summary
Embark on a journey where you'll harness your data programming prowess to transform raw data into compelling narratives. ***Your mission***: select a dataset that intrigues you, meticulously organize and analyze it, and craft insightful visualizations that tell its story. This project culminates in a presentation where you'll showcase your findings, demonstrating the powerful insights that effective data programming can unveil.

:::{warning}
You may **NOT** reuse work that you may have done for another class or club. For example, you cannot take your Data Science project done for **TSA**. Everything must be new. 
:::

During this Final Project you will have four dates to deliver each of the items below. This is an overview of the deliverables at the various stages of your Final Project.

# Operations

* You will self organize into groups of two
* We will use GitHub for all project artifacts
  * You may use Google Docs but must submit markdown versions for these docs to GitHub

# Phases

## #1: [Discovery Document and Raw Data](project/discovery)

You will deliver your initial proposed project and scope.

## #2: [Data Organization](tbd)

You will deliver the following:  

* Reduced and partially organized dataset uploaded to `GitHub`
* Code that partially organizes the data   
* Sketches of target plots  
* Perhaps some Unit Tests (Challenge Goal)  
* Perhaps Web Scraped data or data downloaded via API (Challenge Goal)

## #3: [Final Code & Research Document](tbd)

You will deliver your final code in GitHub using the original starting project provided to you in class as well as a polished research document. The document will focus on the plots and the insights they provide.  

## #4: [Final Presentation](tbd)

This will be your **story** -- a verbal presentation of your Data Science results colored by your subjective journey through the project. You will introduce your research topic, provide context and goals. In short, show plots and explain the results. You will have a slide deck that is almost exclusively a collection of the plots that tell a story.  

# [Challenge Tasks](project/challenges)

You will implement and deliver these either with the `Data Organization` and/or `Final Code and Report` deliverables.
