    "# Classwork : The Admissions Black Box\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a 30-minute activity called **\"The Admissions Black Box.\"** It uses the lesson's Circle/Square analogy to show how bias enters a system and how hard it is to \"fix\" it without losing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Setup (5 Minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Divide the class into small groups (3–4 students). Each group is an **Admissions Committee** for \"Polygon University.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Data:** Give each group a stack of 10 \"Applicant Cards.\"\n",
    "* **Circles:** Mostly have high SAT scores (1400+) and 3+ extracurriculars.\n",
    "* **Squares:** Mostly have mid-range SAT scores (1100–1200) and 1–2 extracurriculars.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Secret \"Ground Truth\":** Tell the students that on this planet, Squares have no access to SAT tutors or expensive sports, but they are equally \"capable\" of succeeding in college.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Phase 1: Human Bias (10 Minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask the groups to quickly select 4 students to admit based **only** on the SAT score and extracurriculars.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Result:** Most groups will admit 4 Circles.\n",
    "* **Discussion:** Ask: \"Is this fair? You picked the 'best' scores, but did you pick the 'best' potential?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Phase 2: The \"Blind\" Algorithm (5 Minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Tell them they are now training an AI. They must create a simple \"Rule\" (an algorithm) for admission.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Constraint:** They are **not allowed** to use the \"Shape\" (Race) variable.\n",
    "* **Common Rule:** *\"Admit if SAT > 1300.\"*\n",
    "* **The Reveal:** Show them that because of the zip codes or school names on the cards (which correlate with the shapes), their \"blind\" rule still only admits Circles.\n",
    "* **Lesson:** Removing the label doesn't remove the bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Phase 3: The Fairness Trade-off (10 Minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, tell the groups they must comply with the **\"Fairness Act of 2026.\"** They must ensure at least 1 Square is admitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The Conflict:** To admit a Square, they have to reject a Circle with a higher SAT score.\n",
    "* **The \"Pareto\" Moment:** Ask the groups:\n",
    "* \"Does your university's 'average SAT' go down? (Accuracy Loss)\"\n",
    "* \"Is it 'fair' to the Circle you rejected? (Individual Fairness)\"\n",
    "* \"Is it 'fair' to the Square community to ignore their lack of tutors? (Group Fairness)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Wrap-up Discussion Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The \"Why\":** If we know the SAT is a biased measure for Squares, should we keep using it?\n",
    "* **Generative AI:** If an AI wrote the \"Acceptance Letters,\" and it used formal, flowery language for Circles but \"simplified\" language for Squares because of their data profile, would that be a problem? (This connects to the **Representational Harm** update in your lesson).\n",
    "* **The Future:** How would a \"Human-in-the-loop\" (a real person checking the AI's math) have changed the outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Would you like me to create the \"Applicant Cards\" text for you to print out, or does this outline work for your planning?**"

    "## **Classroom Debrief: Tying it to 2026 Regulations**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The \"High Risk\" Label:** Under the **EU AI Act**, this admissions model is \"High Risk.\" If your school used it, you would have to prove you checked for the bias that just occurred in the classroom.\n",
    "2. **Individual vs. Group Fairness:** If we admit **S1** over **C4**, we are being \"Group Fair\" (correcting for systemic bias) but **C4** might complain that it's \"Individually Unfair\" because their SAT score was higher. There is no easy math to solve this - it’s a policy decision.\n",
    "3. **The Human in the Loop:** In 2026, we don't let the AI make the final \"Deny.\" We use the AI to flag potential, but a human must look at the \"Context\" column (the \"Why\") to make the final call.\n"
