    "2. `sieve_get_primes`: Code this yourself. Do **NOT** get code from the internet. However, you can learn about _how_ the algorithm works online if the explanation below is insufficient. This implementation will use the algorithm, **Sieve of Eratosthenes**. You'll need to learn the algorithm before you implement it. The algorithm is described below. This specific approach uses sets while most other implementations use arrays of boolean values. Please use this _set_ approach so the implementation can verifiably be your own.   \n",

    "The hailstone sequence is a famous sequence of numbers. As far as we know, no matter what number we start with, the sequence will result in a repeated ending in: `[16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`. If we continue, the sequence repeats `[ 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, ...]` which is why we STOP when we hit the number 1.  \n",

    "One category of algorithmic solutions is called `Dynamic` which means that answers\n",
    "found along with way are cached and reused again later in subsequent solutions. For example, when we solve for the length of the hailstone sequence starting at 6, the second number in the sequence is 3. We've already solved for the length of the sequence for 3 earlier in our loop to build the full dictionary!   \n",

    "Illustrated slightly differently:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "hailstone_length(16) = 1 + hailstone_length(8)\n",
    "hailstone_length(6) = 1 + hailstone_length(3)\n",
    "hailstone_length(5) = 1 + hailstone_length(16)\n",

    "# Profiling\n",
    "It can be cool to see how your code performs line-by-line. Let's profile your code!  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add the package `line-profiler` using the `conda install line_profiler` or find this in your anaconda navigator for your idp environment and add it there. \n",
    "2. Add `@profile` at the top of a few methods that calculate primes and hailstone sequence lengths.\n",
    "3. Add \"import builtins; builtins.profile = builtins.__dict__.get('profile', lambda x: x)\" to the top of your hailstone.py file.\n",
    "4. Add \"@profile\" at the top of your hailstone dynamic programming function\n",
    "5. Run `kernprof -v -l hailstone.py` in the terminal to see the profiler output.\n",
