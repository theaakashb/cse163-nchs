    "# CW: Edge Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "In this activity, you will implement an **edge detection filter** using a **3×3 convolution kernel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* load an image from a file\n",
    "* **convert it to grayscale**\n",
    "* apply an edge detection kernel using **for-loops and NumPy**\n",
    "* threshold the result to a **binary black-and-white image**\n",
    "* display and save your output\n",
    "\n",
    "There is **no test** for this activity. You will show your output images to get checked off.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Convert the image to **grayscale before edge detection**\n",
    "  * Use a **3×3 edge detection kernel** (you must look up an appropriate kernel)\n",
    "  * Perform the convolution using **nested for-loops** and **NumPy slicing**\n",
    "  * Produce an output image that contains **only 0 or 255**\n",
    "* Do **not** modify the original image array in-place.\n",
    "* Your final image must be displayable and saved to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step-by-Step Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Implement `edge_detect(filename)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function called:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "edge_detect(filename: str) -> None:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This function should:\n",
    "\n",
    "* accept the filename of a JPEG image\n",
    "* load the image into a NumPy array\n",
    "* display the final processed image\n",
    "* save the output image to a file\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Convert the image to grayscale\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying edge detection, convert the color image to **grayscale**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The input image will have shape `(height, width, 3)`\n",
    "* A grayscale image has shape `(height, width)`\n",
    "* Grayscale values are typically computed from the **R, G, and B channels together**\n",
    "* There is more than one valid grayscale formula — choose one and be consistent\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of this step, you should be working with a **single-channel image**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Choose a 3×3 edge detection kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Look up a **3×3 edge detection kernel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Search for kernels such as *Laplacian*, *Sobel*, or *Prewitt*\n",
    "* Some kernels detect edges in a specific direction\n",
    "* Write a short comment explaining which kernel you chose and why\n",
    "\n",
    "You should store your kernel as a 3×3 NumPy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Apply the kernel using convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply your kernel to the grayscale image using convolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For each pixel (except the borders):\n",
    "\n",
    "  * extract a 3×3 window of the image\n",
    "  * multiply it element-wise by the kernel\n",
    "  * sum the result to get the new pixel value\n",
    "* Use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * nested `for` loops for row and column traversal\n",
    "  * NumPy slicing to extract the 3×3 window\n",
    "* Store results in a **new output array**, not the input image\n",
    "\n",
    "Border handling hint:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may skip the outermost pixels to keep things simple\n",
    "* Optimally - you can use np.pad to add a border to keep the image sizes equivalent\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Prepare the result for display\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution can produce values that are negative or larger than 255.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Think about what the **magnitude** of an edge represents\n",
    "* Decide how to convert your convolution output into something that can be displayed\n",
    "* You may find it useful to use absolute values or clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6) Threshold to a binary (0 / 255) image\n",
    "\n",
    "Convert your processed image into a **black-and-white** image:\n",
    "\n",
    "* values greater than 127 → 255\n",
    "* values 127 or below → 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Your final image should contain **only two values**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7) Display and save the result\n",
    "\n",
    "* Display your black-and-white edge image\n",
    "* Save it to a file (PNG recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the saved image opens correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "* Experiment with a **different kernel** and compare results\n",
    "* Try applying the kernel before thresholding and visualizing the intermediate result\n",
    "* Consider how border handling affects the output\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Check-off\n",
    "\n",
    "Raise your **Paddlepop** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* your image is successfully edge-detected\n",
    "* your output is black-and-white (0 or 255 only)\n",
    "* your image is displayed and saved\n",
