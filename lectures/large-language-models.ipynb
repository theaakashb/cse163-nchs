    "### Instruction fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning in the world of neural networks is to take an already trained network, and use another dataset to run through some training iterations again to update that trained network's parameters so that the fine-tuned version can perform better on a task related to that second dataset. Similar ideas work well for transformers too.\n",

    "### Reinforcement learning from human feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning refers to a kind of machine learning where a policy is learned so that an agent will follow this policy to take an action to respond to different states in order to achieve the maximum accumulated reward. The reinforcement aspect basically refers to the fact that the agent behavior is \"guided\" by the reward, and rewards in the desired behavior reinforces the agent's learned policy so that it will tend to choose actions that lead to greater rewards. For LLM agents, human-in-the-loop feedback is also very helpful.\n",

    "### Few-shot learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the previous two techniques that improve LLM training, few-shot learning does not change model parameters but simply employ interesting prompting strategies by providing examples in the prompt so that the LLM can learn through its context window.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)\n",
    "\n",
    "> While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chain-of-thought prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting strategy is to include all the intermediate steps, which is a kind of few-show learning but brings it one step further.\n",

    "[Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903)\n",
    "\n",
    "> We explore how generating a chain of thought -- a series of intermediate reasoning steps -- significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning. In particular, we show how such reasoning abilities emerge naturally in sufficiently large language models via a simple method called chain of thought prompting, where a few chain of thought demonstrations are provided as exemplars in prompting. Experiments on three large language models show that chain of thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. The empirical gains can be striking. For instance, prompting a 540B-parameter language model with just eight chain of thought exemplars achieves state of the art accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark of math word problems, surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.\n",

    "> ToT allows LMs to perform deliberate decision making by considering multiple different reasoning paths and self-evaluating choices to decide the next course of action, as well as looking ahead or backtracking when necessary to make global choices."

In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters.... Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.\n",
